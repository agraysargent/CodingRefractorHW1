# Coding Refractor
This assignment that was given to us required us to refractor HTML & CSS on an SEO and Marketing website. The goal of the assignment was to ensure that the codebase met accessibility standards and keep the code to readable standards.

# User Story
AS A marketing agency I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards, SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

# Description
An increasingly important consideration for businesses, web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for business for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website. A common task that novice developers will find themselves completing is taking existing code and refractoring it to meet industry and/or client standards.

# Considerations
As you work through the assignment try to keep one of the most important coding rules/standards in mind: always leave code cleaner than when you originally found it. By sticking to this standard, it will be easier to provide longterm stability for the client. In addition to keeping items user-friendly and accessible, while also making sure the links function properly.

# Updates
Condensed headers and cleaned up duplicate headers.
Renamed non-semantic elements to semantic elements.
Re-Structured HTML & CSS for readability.
Improved accessibility for screen readers.

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards WHEN I view the source code THEN I find semantic HTML elements WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning WHEN I view the image elements THEN I find accessible alt attributes WHEN I view the heading attributes THEN they fall in sequential order WHEN I view the title element THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
